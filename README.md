## Introduction
As a kid I had quite a few lego sets to play with. One day cleaning up the attic I came acros these lego set and decides to build all of them. As expected I was missing a few parts and wanted to buy the missing parts. I created and excel file containing all the missing
parts. Bricklink is a great place to buy all the missing parts but it is a daunting task to enter all the parts in the wishlist.
When I discovered that there is a possibility to mass upload all the parts using an XML file I decided to write a script to convert
the excel list into the xml file so that it can be uploaded to Bricklink.

This repository contains scripts to parse, convert and create lego parts lists.

## Usage

### bricklink.py
This script creates an xml file of lego parts which can be uploaded to the site [bricklink.com](https://www.bricklink.com). It takes a list of lego colors and a CSV file as input. It will create the file bricklink.xml.

1. Save the wanted_list.xlsx file as a csv file
1. Run the command: `python bricklink.py --sep <separator-char> lego_colors.tsf wanted_list.csv`
1. Open the file bricklink.xml in your favorite editor
1. Copy and paste the contents into the  [upload page](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/wanted/upload.page) of bricklink
